# Auditor Bundle Routes
#
# Routes are automatically registered when kachnitel/admin-bundle is installed.
# The AuditorRouteLoader is registered via AdminBundleIntegrationPass compiler pass.
#
# To manually import (if auto-registration doesn't work), add to config/routes.yaml:
#   dh_auditor:
#       resource: .
#       type: dh_auditor

dh_auditor:
    resource: .
    type: dh_auditor
